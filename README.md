# 👋 Hey there, I'm Branislav Jankovic!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where bugs fear me (sometimes), and clean code is my love language.

## 💼 About Me

I'm a seasoned Front-End Developer who speaks fluent React and TypeScript. With over 10 years of experience building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications, I’ve wrestled with countless APIs, wrestled with state management (and won), and made peace with CSS (well, mostly).

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 💻 **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS
- ⚛️ **Frameworks**: React
- 🎨 **UI Libraries**: MUI, ANTDesign, Tailwind CSS
- 🔄 **State Management**: Zustand, Redux, Mobx, React Query
- 📦 **Tools**: Vite, Webpack, Git, VS Code
- 🚀 **Others**: Node.js, REST APIs, OpenAI integration, Testing (Jest, Testing Library)

## 🎯 What I'm Working On

- Building AI-enhanced dashboards
- Making enterprise UIs that don't make your eyes bleed
- Writing code that my future self won’t hate

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate!

Have a cool project? Found a bug? Want to nerd out over component architecture? I'm always open to ideas, feedback, and memes.

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- I consider `console.log()` a debugging soulmate
- My favorite component is the one that works on the first render (rare, but magical)
- I drink more coffee than my code has comments (don’t worry — still enough comments)

Thanks for stopping by — may your builds be green and your bugs reproducible! 🐛
